        "We have created a music database app in order to cater to the millions of people that stream music today. The vision behind this is similar to other services such as Spotify or Amazon music where users can create an account in our database and with a subscription can access a catalog of near infinite, and growing songs. From there, users can not only find music they want to listen to,but also listen to podcasts. Anything users listen to gives suggestion algorithms used by our streaming service data in order to find something else you might like to listen to, as to give the user great discovery tools. Everything a user has listened to can be seen in their total plays and past listened to songs, so you can go back to old favorites whenever you want to. As well, the top songs on our platform are listed up front for everyone to experience and to see how many people have already listened to the most popular songs. In order to create a database to manage the information about the user, music they listen to, podcasts and their service subscription, we used 5 database tables. These are:  userInformation, userTransaction, podcasts, songInformation and songPlays. "

There would be different genres to explore, pages for artists, and naturally the names of the songs. The second table is Podcasts. Podcasts would be listed in their own section. This would have the podcasts decription, the user who posted it, and different metrics on popularity and time listened. There would also be genres in podcasts, allowing users to explore podcasts similar to the ones they already listen to. The third table is Song Plays, which would keep track of how many times a song is played, the frequency within the plays, and the type of users who listen to the song. This would be used to create charts and playlists for diffrent users. The fourth table is User Information. This is a profile for users to store what artists and songs they like, create playlists, look at their data, and know if they have a premium (ad free) membership or not. The fifth table is User Transaction and it would keep track of when the user would have purchased a premium membership, the cost, how long they've had it, and when it must be renewed. "

The insert statements kept track of the attributes of the table. In song information, for instance, there are entries for the primary key, then the title of the song, who it was written by, whether it was on a single or an album, and what genre the song would fall under. For plays there are entries for its key, how many times it was played that day, week, month, and total, along with the song's ID. For podcasts, there is space for the key, what the podcast is called, its genre, plays, and listeners, along with its runtime. Each user has a key that is recorded, what songs and podcasts they listen to, how many plays they have, what their account is named, when it was created, and if they're a free or premium member. Finally, we wanted to keep track of how the user pays for their account, along with giving them information about it. There is a key for each user's card, how many times they've paid, how much they have been charged, and whenever their next payment is due. "
